HI,

I don't know what i'm doing honestly. 
I'm just a student learning programming and right now I jsut want to explore and find out what i'm interested in.
if for some reason you want to invite me to contribute to your project, honestly, i don't know how much help I would be.
However, I would be really grateful if you'd give me the chance to study and learn.

Thanks!
